Bit-Vector-Array version 0.01
=============================

This module allows you to create and manipulate bit
vector arrays (BVA). A BVA can be store or fetch
an integer value when using the whole array.
To store or fetch this value, you must use 
the $# sigil in front of the array name, 
rather then the @ sigil normally associated with arrays.

You can also index into the array and this will allow
you to fetch and store individual bit values in the
integer.


use Bit::Vector::Array;

# bva is an exported sub to create a bit vector array

bva(my @arr1);
bva(my @arr2);
bva(my @arr3);

# always use $# sigil rather than the @ sigil when
# fetching or storing as integer values.
$#arr1=7;
$#arr2=11;
$#arr3 = $#arr1 * $#arr2;
# $#arr3 is 77


# index into the array when fetching or 
# storing individual bits
$#arr3=0;
$arr3[0]=1;	#	$#arr3 == 1
$arr3[1]=1;	#	$#arr3 == 3
$arr3[2]=1;	#	$#arr3 == 7
